Hello my name is Ben, I am from Leeds in the UK. I have lived in UK all my life, I currently live in London as I am undertaking my Masters at London Business School.

I enjoy reading, politics and going to the cinema. I am also trying to learn french as it is one of my life goals to learn a new language.
